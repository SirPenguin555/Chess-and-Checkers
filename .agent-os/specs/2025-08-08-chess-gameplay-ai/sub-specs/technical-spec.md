# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-chess-gameplay-ai/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Chess Engine Core
- Complete chess move generation and validation system
- Board representation using standard FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation)
- Comprehensive rule implementation including special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection algorithms
- Move history tracking with algebraic notation

### Stockfish Integration
- Stockfish WASM integration or web worker implementation
- AI difficulty levels mapped to depth and time controls
- Move evaluation and best move selection
- Performance optimization to ensure sub-3 second response times
- Error handling for engine failures or timeout scenarios

### User Interface Requirements
- Interactive 8x8 chess board with proper coordinate system
- Drag-and-drop piece movement with visual feedback
- Highlight system for legal moves and current selection
- Responsive design working on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Loading states and AI thinking indicators

### Game State Management
- Real-time game state synchronization with Zustand store
- Persistent storage integration with Supabase database
- Game serialization/deserialization for save/resume functionality
- Move history and game metadata tracking
- Undo/redo capability for human moves (not AI moves)

### Performance Criteria
- Board rendering: < 100ms initial load
- Move validation: < 10ms per move
- AI response time: < 3s for medium difficulty, < 10s for hardest
- Smooth animations at 60fps for piece movements
- Memory usage optimization for long games

## Approach Options

**Option A: Stockfish.js with Web Workers**
- Pros: Full Stockfish power, runs in browser, no server dependency
- Cons: Large bundle size (~2MB), requires WASM support

**Option B: Stockfish API Service** (Selected)
- Pros: Smaller client bundle, server can handle multiple engines, easier scaling
- Cons: Network dependency, API rate limiting considerations

**Rationale:** Selected Option B for Phase 1 to reduce client complexity and bundle size. The API approach allows better control over difficulty levels and provides consistent performance across devices. We can migrate to client-side later if needed.

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Pros: Fallback capability, best of both worlds
- Cons: Complex implementation, harder to test and maintain

## External Dependencies

- **stockfish** (v16+) - Chess engine for AI opponent functionality
- **chess.js** - Chess game logic, move validation, and board representation
- **Justification:** chess.js provides battle-tested chess logic with FEN support, algebraic notation, and comprehensive move validation. Stockfish is the world's strongest chess engine and essential for providing challenging AI opponents.

- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Database integration for game persistence
- **Justification:** Already part of our tech stack for authentication and real-time features

- **canvas-confetti** (optional) - Victory celebration effects
- **Justification:** Lightweight library for enhanced user experience during game completion

## Implementation Architecture

### Component Structure
```
components/chess/
├── ChessBoard.tsx           # Main board component
├── ChessSquare.tsx          # Individual square component
├── ChessPiece.tsx           # Piece component with drag handlers
├── GameControls.tsx         # Start/resign/difficulty controls
├── MoveHistory.tsx          # Move list and navigation
├── GameStatus.tsx          # Current game state display
└── AIThinkingIndicator.tsx  # AI processing indicator
```

### Game Logic Structure
```
lib/chess/
├── chessEngine.ts          # Core game logic and rules
├── stockfishWorker.ts      # Stockfish web worker wrapper
├── gameState.ts           # Zustand store for game state
├── moveValidation.ts      # Move validation utilities
├── boardUtils.ts          # Board manipulation utilities
└── gameStorage.ts         # Supabase integration for persistence
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with ChessBoard component
2. Move passed to chessEngine for validation
3. Valid moves update Zustand store and trigger AI
4. AI worker calculates best move via Stockfish
5. AI move updates game state and triggers re-render
6. Game state persisted to Supabase after each move

## Integration Points

- **Supabase Database:** Game persistence and user session management
- **Zustand Store:** Real-time game state management across components
- **Next.js API Routes:** Stockfish engine communication and move processing
- **TanStack Query:** Caching and synchronization of game data
- **Framer Motion:** Smooth piece movement animations
