> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a complete chess gameplay system with professional-grade AI integration using Stockfish engine. This foundational feature will provide users with a fully functional chess game including move validation, game state management, and multiple AI difficulty levels, establishing the core engine that all other chess features will build upon.

## User Stories

### Chess Player vs AI Opponent

As a chess enthusiast, I want to play against a strong AI opponent with adjustable difficulty, so that I can practice and improve my skills at my own pace.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User opens the chess game interface
2. User selects "Play vs Computer" option
3. User chooses AI difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)
4. Game board displays with proper piece positioning
5. User makes moves by clicking and dragging pieces
6. AI responds with moves based on selected difficulty
7. Game validates all moves according to chess rules
8. Game ends with checkmate, stalemate, or resignation
9. Game history and final position are saved

### Game State Management

As a chess player, I want my game to be automatically saved and resumable, so that I can continue playing even if I need to close the browser.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Game automatically saves state after each move
2. User can close browser/tab during gameplay
3. Upon return, user sees option to resume game
4. Clicking resume restores exact board position and game history
5. Game continues seamlessly from where it left off

### Move Validation and Rule Enforcement

As a player, I want the game to only allow legal chess moves and enforce all rules, so that I can focus on strategy without worrying about rule violations.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User attempts to move a piece
2. Game validates move according to chess rules
3. Valid moves are executed with smooth animation
4. Invalid moves are rejected with visual feedback
5. Special moves (castling, en passant, promotion) work correctly
6. Check and checkmate conditions are detected automatically

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Chess Rule Implementation** - All standard chess rules including castling, en passant, pawn promotion, check, checkmate, and stalemate detection
2. **Stockfish AI Integration** - Working integration with Stockfish engine providing multiple difficulty levels from beginner to expert
3. **Interactive Game Board** - Responsive chess board with drag-and-drop piece movement and visual feedback for valid/invalid moves
4. **Game State Persistence** - Save and resume functionality using Supabase database with complete move history tracking
5. **Move Validation Engine** - Comprehensive move validation system ensuring 100% rule compliance and preventing illegal moves

## Out of Scope

- Multiplayer functionality (handled in Phase 2)
- Game analysis features (handled in Phase 5)
- 3D chess or game variations (handled in Phase 4)
- Advanced visual themes and customization (handled in Phase 3)
- Tournament systems or rankings (handled in Phase 5)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Chess Game** - Users can play complete chess games from start to finish against AI opponents with proper rule enforcement
2. **AI Integration Working** - Stockfish engine responds with appropriate moves based on selected difficulty level within reasonable time limits
3. **Game Persistence** - Games automatically save and can be resumed exactly where left off across browser sessions
