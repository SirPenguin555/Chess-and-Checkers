## 2025-08-08: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Launch a comprehensive chess and checkers platform targeting chess enthusiasts, casual gamers, and competitive players. The platform will offer both traditional gameplay and innovative variations like 3D chess and chess vs checkers, with AI opponents, real-time multiplayer, and tournament systems.

### Context

The chess/checkers gaming market has established players like Chess.com and Lichess, but there's an opportunity for a platform that:
1. Combines both chess and checkers in one high-quality experience
2. Offers innovative game variations not available elsewhere
3. Provides world-class AI integration with professional engines
4. Creates a modern, beautifully designed user experience

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Chess-Only Platform**
   - Pros: Focused scope, larger chess community, established market patterns
   - Cons: Crowded market, harder differentiation, smaller potential user base

2. **Casual Mobile Game Approach**
   - Pros: Broader appeal, simpler development, proven monetization
   - Cons: Less differentiation, lower engagement from serious players, limited competitive features

3. **Educational Focus Platform**
   - Pros: Clear value proposition, potential institutional customers, less competitive
   - Cons: Smaller market, complex sales cycles, different technical requirements

### Rationale

We chose the comprehensive dual-game platform approach because:
- **Market Opportunity:** No major platform effectively serves both chess and checkers communities
- **Differentiation:** Game variations like 3D chess and hybrid modes create unique value
- **Technical Feasibility:** Modern web technologies make complex game logic and real-time multiplayer achievable
- **User Base Synergy:** Chess and checkers players often enjoy both games, creating cross-pollination opportunities
- **Competitive Advantage:** Professional AI integration (Stockfish) combined with beautiful UX

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unique position in the market with both games
- Multiple user segments (casual, competitive, educational)
- Strong differentiation through game variations
- Potential for viral sharing of unique game modes
- Comprehensive platform creates higher user engagement

**Negative:**
- More complex development scope than single-game focus
- Need to balance resources between chess and checkers features
- Requires expertise in both game domains
- Higher initial development investment
- Need to compete with established chess platforms

## 2025-08-08: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Supabase instead of Firebase for backend services, while maintaining other Agent OS standards (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.). This creates a hybrid approach combining the reliability of Agent OS patterns with Supabase's superior developer experience for this specific use case.

### Context

The project requires real-time multiplayer capabilities, user authentication, and complex game state management. The choice is between Firebase (Agent OS standard) and Supabase for backend services.

### Rationale

**Supabase chosen because:**
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database better suited for game relationships (users, games, tournaments, moves)
- **Real-time Features:** Supabase Realtime is excellent for live multiplayer games
- **Developer Experience:** Better local development with Supabase CLI
- **SQL Familiarity:** Team has strong SQL skills
- **Game Queries:** Complex tournament brackets and statistics easier with SQL

**Maintaining Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind because:**
- Proven combination for complex applications
- Excellent TypeScript integration for game logic
- Superior SEO for sharing games and tournaments
- Component-based architecture ideal for game UI

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better database model for game relationships
- Excellent real-time multiplayer capabilities
- Strong local development workflow
- Easier complex queries for tournaments and statistics

**Negative:**
- Deviation from Agent OS Firebase standard
- Team needs to learn Supabase patterns
- Different deployment considerations
- Need to adapt some Agent OS best practices

## 2025-08-08: Game Engine Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Game Development Team

### Decision

Implement a hybrid architecture using Stockfish (via WebAssembly or API) for chess AI and custom JavaScript for checkers AI, with separate game logic modules for each game type and variations.

### Context

The platform needs to support multiple game types (chess, checkers, variations) with different AI requirements and rule systems.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Universal Game Engine**
   - Pros: Consistent architecture, easier maintenance
   - Cons: Over-engineering, doesn't leverage chess-specific tools like Stockfish

2. **External API for All AI**
   - Pros: Offload computation, easier scaling
   - Cons: Network latency, dependency on external services, cost

### Rationale

**Hybrid approach chosen because:**
- **Chess Expertise:** Stockfish is world-class, no need to rebuild
- **Checkers Simplicity:** Custom AI sufficient and allows optimization
- **Performance:** Mix of local and optimized computation
- **Flexibility:** Can optimize each game type independently
- **Cost Effective:** Avoid external API costs for simple checkers AI

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- World-class chess AI through Stockfish
- Optimized performance for each game type
- Flexibility to enhance each engine independently
- Lower operational costs

**Negative:**
- More complex architecture with multiple AI systems
- Need expertise in both integration and custom AI development
- Potential inconsistencies in AI difficulty between games
- More testing required for multiple systems
